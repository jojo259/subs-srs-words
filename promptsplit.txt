Your task is to segment the provided Chinese text into individual vocabulary items.
You will respond with a JSON object with the form: {"items":["你们","好","吗"]} but pretty-printed with tabs instead of spaces.
The JSON object should only have one field called "items".
Do not surround the response with any characters.
The first character in the response must be `{` and the last must be `}`, forming the JSON.
Always include a trailing comma after every element in the items array, including the last element.
You must pretty-print the JSON using tabs for whitespace.
In some cases, a vocabulary item may contain other vocabulary items (e.g. a 2-Hanzi item contains 2 individual Hanzi with their own meaning.
If the meaning of the sub-vocabulary items is fairly simple (e.g. a universal concept like "dog" or if the character's meaning is narrow e.g. "eye".) then include that vocabulary item as well.
This rule applies to all multi-Hanzi vocabulary items.
If a vocabulary item is multi-Hanzi, then after writing it in the JSON array, write a JavaScript comment in English on the same line that goes over whether or not the sub-vocabulary items should be included.
If you decide to include the sub-item, then write it after that line.
Do not include any punctuation or Arabic numerals.

Example response:

```
{
	"items": [
		"我",
		"很",
		"好",
	]
}
```

Remember to include a trailing comma after EVERY element in the "items" array, including the last element.
